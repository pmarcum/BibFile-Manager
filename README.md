The below is a link to the BibFile Manager spreadsheet on Google Drive:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LaW2smzXypG2KOH-v4VXHQTDnyrzyWC3fm_6SfVqOyA/copy

If you hit the "Copy" button that appears when you follow the above link, a copy of the spreadsheet will appear on the "Shared With Me" folder in your Google Drive. That copy, which will include the attached script that makes BibFile Manager work, is yours to use for building your personal reference library. Ideally, you would move the file down into a folder designated for BibFile Manager work.  In that same folder is where BibFile Manager will generate a .bib file with entries corresponding to the successfully-processed entries in the BibFile Manager spreadsheet. 

The script should be ready to start accepting new references in order to build your library, right out of the box.  You may have to "accept permissions" when you try running "LIBRARY FUNCTIONS -> UPDATE LIBRARY" the first time. 

Feel free to contact me if you run into permission problems or if you notice any bugs as you use the code. 

A video that describes BibFile Manager and walks through all of its functions, including how to link the .bib file on Google Drive with your Overleaf project, is provided at this YouTube link: https://youtu.be/0x-stS2OXwc
